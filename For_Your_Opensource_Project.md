## Getting Started with MicroUI

To integrate MicroUI into your open-source project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install MicroUI

MicroUI is available from its official repository. You can download and include it in your project as needed.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Depending on your target platform, you may also need to install additional libraries like SDL or GLFW for window management and rendering.

### Step 3: Create a Basic MicroUI Application

Let's start with a simple example to create a basic MicroUI application. We'll use SDL for window management in this example.

#### Example: Basic MicroUI Application with SDL

Create a file named `main.c` and add the following code:

```c
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>
#include "microui.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) != 0) {
        printf("SDL_Init Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        return 1;
    }

    SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("MicroUI Open-Source Project",
                                          SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                          SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
                                          800, 600, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
    if (!window) {
        printf("SDL_CreateWindow Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        SDL_Quit();
        return 1;
    }

    SDL_Renderer *renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);
    if (!renderer) {
        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
        printf("SDL_CreateRenderer Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        SDL_Quit();
        return 1;
    }

    mu_Context ctx;
    mu_init(&ctx);

    // Main loop
    int running = 1;
    while (running) {
        SDL_Event event;
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
            if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
                running = 0;
            }
            // Handle input events and pass them to MicroUI
        }

        SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 0, 0, 255);
        SDL_RenderClear(renderer);

        // Render MicroUI elements
        mu_begin(&ctx);
        mu_end(&ctx);

        SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
    }

    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}
```

### Step 4: Compile and Run Your Application

Compile your program using the following command:

```sh
gcc -o microui_project main.c -lSDL2
```

Run the program:

```sh
./microui_project
```

You should see a window titled "MicroUI Open-Source Project" with a black background.

## Advanced Usage and Customization

MicroUI is highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the UI to your project's needs. Here are some advanced features you can explore:

### Custom Themes and Styles

MicroUI allows you to define custom themes and styles to match your project's branding or design requirements. You can customize colors, fonts, and other UI elements to create a unique look and feel.

```c
void set_custom_style(mu_Context *ctx) {
    mu_Style *style = &ctx->style;
    style->colors[MU_COLOR_WINDOWBG] = mu_color(30, 30, 30, 255);
    style->colors[MU_COLOR_TITLEBG] = mu_color(60, 60, 60, 255);
    style->colors[MU_COLOR_TEXT] = mu_color(255, 255, 255, 255);
    style->font = my_custom_font;
}
```

### Event Handling and Input Management

MicroUI provides a flexible event handling system to manage user input. You can easily handle keyboard, mouse, and touch events to create interactive applications.

```c
void handle_input(mu_Context *ctx, SDL_Event *event) {
    switch (event->type) {
        case SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
        case SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            mu_input_mousedown(ctx, event->button.x, event->button.y, event->button.button);
            break;
        case SDL_MOUSEMOTION:
            mu_input_mousemove(ctx, event->motion.x, event->motion.y);
            break;
        case SDL_KEYDOWN:
        case SDL_KEYUP:
            mu_input_keydown(ctx, event->key.keysym.sym);
            break;
    }
}
```

### Creating Complex UI Components

MicroUI allows you to create complex UI components by combining basic elements. You can build custom widgets and controls to suit your application's needs.

```c
void create_custom_window(mu_Context *ctx) {
    if (mu_begin_window(ctx, "Custom Window", mu_rect(10, 10, 300, 200))) {
        mu_label(ctx, "This is a custom window.");
        mu_button(ctx, "Click me");
        mu_end_window(ctx);
    }
}
```
